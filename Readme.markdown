# K&R Examples and Exercises

This is a collection of the examples and exercises in [The C Programming Language](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0131103628?ie=UTF8&tag=samsoffescom-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0131103628) book (second edition), or K&R book.

There are quite possibly better solutions to the exercises than what I have written, as I'm not super proficient in C (yet!). I figure if I type all of the examples and work all of the exercises, I'll be pretty decent at C by the end of the book (and hopefully improved my typing skills as well).

Feel free to do whatever you want with any of this. It's mainly for my own learning, but I figured I'd share.
